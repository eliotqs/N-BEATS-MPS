# N-BEATS-MPS
This repo contains a notebook with a Pytorch implementation of N-BEATS-MPS from the thesis of Yves Vanbrussel and Eliot Sodji: Improving forecast stability using deep learning; an extension to multiperiod foecast instability.
We used the Pytorch implementation of Van Belle J. as a starting point (https://github.com/KU-Leuven-LIRIS/n-beats-s).
